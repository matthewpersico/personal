=head1 NAME

git-push - extension to git push

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 git-push [STANDARD OPTS] --pr[-force]|no-pr ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calls the real 'git push' and then processes our options, if specified.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item pr

Start a browser (via git web--browser) pointing to the URL to create a new pull request using the current repo as the source if there is no existing PR. If there is an existing PR, its URL is used.

Note: This only really works with the triangle workflow of forked 'origin' and original 'upstream' or an original 'origin'. Those assumptions are baked into a lot of the logic. Any other push targets, go open a PR in the GUI.

=back

=item pr-force

Same as --pr, but skip the lookup for an existing PR and assume there isn't one. Useful when you know there is no PR and the repo is old and the lookup would take minutes.

Note: This only really works with the triangle workflow of forked 'origin' and original 'upstream' or an original 'origin'. Those assumptions are baked into a lot of the logic. Any other push targets, go open a PR in the GUI.

=item no-pr

Passed to us so that logic in 'git commit' is more straightforward. We explictily don't do any pull request processing.
