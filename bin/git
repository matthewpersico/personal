# git

# A wrapper around 'git' to extend it.

# If you want to add the command 'foo' to 'git', you can simply create the
# file 'git-foo', put it on your PATH, and invoke it as 'git foo'.

# However, if you want to add to an EXISTING command, this doesn't work;
# git-worktree on your PATH will not be called instead of 'git worktree'.

# Soooooo, we have this wrapper that will see if a script exists on the path
# for the given command, and if so, call that command. Otherwise, pass the
# command off to git.

# Note that your script git-bar that extends an EXISTING command 'git bar' must
# be able to determine when to handle the extended request itself and when to
# hand off to the existing command, which will can be referenced as

# "$REALGIT" bar

# because $REALGIT will not run YOUR git-bar (which is why we have THIS script
# at all) and you won't have an endless loop.

# The variables REALGIT and REALGIT_EXEC_PATH are defined in git.env
