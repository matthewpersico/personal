# A wrapper around 'git' to extend it.

# If you want to add the command 'foobar' to 'git', you can simply create the
# file 'git-foobar', put it on your PATH, and invoke it as 'git foobar'.

# However, if you want to extend an existing command, this doesn't work;
# git-worktree on your PATH will not be called instead of 'git worktree'.

# Soooooo, we have this wrapper that will see if a script exists on the path
# for the given command, and if so, call that command. Otherwise, pass the
# command off to git.

# The variable REALGIT is defined in git.env
