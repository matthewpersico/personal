=head1 NAME

git-bisect - extensions to git bisect

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 git-bisect end|exit|quit|abort
 git-bisect start --terms=oldterm/newterm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Additions and documentations for 'git bisect'.

=head1 ARGMENTS

=over 4

=item end|exit|quit|abort

Synonyms for 'reset' with no commit argument. Restores the repo to the
condition it was in before starting, especially reseting the commit that is
checked out.

=item start --terms

When bisecting, the terms 'good' and 'bad' assume that you are looking for a
change that broke code, that the older commits are good and the new commits are
bad. This may not always be the case. You may be looking for the commit in
which a file appeared. In that case, the older code would be the 'missing'
state and the newer code would be the 'exists' state.

By calling

  git bisect start --terms=missing/exists

you are really calling

  git bisect start --term-old=missing --term-new=exists

and you can then conduct your search like this:

  git bisect missing some-older-sha ## where the file does not exist
  git bisect exists some-newer-sha ## where the file does exist
  prevsha=''
  thissha=$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD)
  while [ "$prevesha" != "$thissha" ]; do
    if [ -f TheFileIAmLookingFor ]; then
      git bisect exists
    else
      git bisect missing
    fi
    prevsha=$thissha
    thissha=$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD)
  done
  [ -f TheFileIAmLookingFor ] && echo found the sha where it was created || echo did not find it

Of course, if you want to find where a file disappears:

  git bisect start --terms=exists/missing
  git bisect exists some-older-sha
  git bisect missing some-newer-sha

  prevsha=''
  thissha=$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD)
  while [ "$prevesha" != "$thissha" ]; do
    if [ -f TheFileIAmLookingFor ]; then
      git bisect exists
    else
      git bisect missing
    fi
    prevsha=$thissha
    thissha=$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD)
  done
  [ -f TheFileIAmLookingFor ] && echo still exists || echo found the sha where it disappeared

**Note:** The '=' is required; --terms missing/exists will fail due to the
  simple parsing we are wrapping around this git command.

**Note:** You cannot reassign the word 'good', i.e; you cannot do this:

  git bisect start --term-old=bad --term-new=good

which essenially swaps the typical usage (was good, is now bad). Use

  git bisect start --term-old=broken --term-new=fixed

instead. In fact, the typical usage could be redefined as

  git bisect start --term-old=fixed --term-new=broken
