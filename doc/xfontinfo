You can check X11 server side fonts with:
$ xlsfonts -fn '*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-m*'
$ xlsfonts -fn '*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-c*'
The 'm' stands for monospace and the 'c' for character cell.  But, given it's happening on some machines and not others it is probably related to client side fonts not being installed
11:46:08 For that, you can do:
$ fc-list :spacing=mono
$ fc-list :space=cell
