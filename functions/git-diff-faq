--- Branch diffing

The trick to diffing two branches is that is must be done locally. Make sure
both branches have been pulled down from their remotes before tyring to use
them in a diff.

diff two branches:
    git diff branch1 branch2

diff current branch vs other branch:
    git diff other

    *Note - the sense of the diff is from the other back to the current, as if
            you typed 'git diff other current' . If you want the diff from
            current to other then use 'git diff current other'

diff specific files between two branches:
    git diff branch1 branch2 -- file [file...]

EOF
}
