# README
All my UNIX goodies including dotfiles so I can put them on any machine.

There are two items to read:

* If you simply want to sync your local environment with the GitHub repo
  directly, read [README-direct](README-direct.md).
* If you need to make a local GHE repo the primary source and sync that with
  the GitHub repo, then read [README-GHE](README-GHE.md) instead.
